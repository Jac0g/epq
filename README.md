## Abstract

## Remarks
### Format
The following project will be made entirely in a Markdown format. From the
official website:

> Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting
elements to plaintext text documents.

Markdown is mostly used for simple tasks where minimal formatting is needed,
e.g. emails, technical documentations or notes. Consequently, it might be
argued that such a format is inappropriate for an extensive academic project,
such as this one. 

However, every issue that may be encountered has been carefully considered and
accounted for. Moreover, this format brings some substantial benefits over
standard solutions (PDF, DOCX, etc.) to both the author and the readers,
namely:

- **Interactivity**
    - Video demonstrations are necessary for showcasing the OS at work
    - External links make it easier to link sources of information
    - Internal links make traversing the document effortless
- **Minimalistic design**
    - Easier editing
    - Better readability
- **Accessibility**
    - This document is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/) where Markdown
      is neatly integrated for viewing and accessing such projects

### Activity Logging
Thorough logging of every undertaken action is both a requirement and a big
part of the project. The initial solution was to write a [custom Python
program](activity.py) called the *Activity Logger* to provide an all-in-one
[file](activity.log) with activities as plain text entries:

```
    _        _   _       _ _            _                                    
   / \   ___| |_(_)_   _(_) |_ _   _   | | ___   __ _  __ _  ___ _ __       
  / _ \ / __| __| \ \ / / | __| | | |  | |/ _ \ / _` |/ _` |/ _ \ __|

Nevertheless, this solution has proved to be unsustainable in the long run, as
the program needed to be improved and maintained, which put a significant, but
more importantly an unnecessary, extra load.

A better solution turned out to be the use of an already existing and utilised
system â€” GitHub. At its core, GitHub is a website and cloud-based service for
sharing code, which incorporates a [Version Control
System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) (VCS) called
[git](https://git-scm.com/). 

This system provides an extremely detailed breakdown of every little change in
the system, right down to a side-to-side comparison of every altered line of
code *(fig. 1)*. Yet understandability remains unharmed, as all the changes can
be presented with a short description on a simple timeline *(fig. 2)*, thus
each aspect of this solution has been proven to be superior to the previous
one.

# Why Linux?
There are three major Operating Systems (OSs) *(fig 3)*:
1. Windows
2. Mac OS
3. Linux

The most popular one OS by far is Windows, accounting for roughly 70% of global
market share. It is aimed to be compatible with as many devices as possible,
hence it is a go-to choice of all major PC/laptop manufacturers.

On the second place is Mac OS at around 15% market share.
